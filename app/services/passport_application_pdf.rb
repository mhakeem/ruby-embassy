require "prawn"

# Builds the official Ruby Embassy passport application PDF.
#
# Aesthetic: as formal as a US tax form. No logo, no flourishes.
# DejaVu Sans throughout (TTF, broad Unicode coverage so user-typed glyphs
# outside Windows-1252 don't crash the renderer). Fine 0.5pt rules,
# OMB-style form code in the top-right, "FOR OFFICIAL EMBASSY USE ONLY"
# stamp area on the notary page, page numbering in the bottom margin.
#
# Layout: short-form questions (short / select / date / checkbox) flow
# in two columns; long-form questions (long / checkbox_group) span the
# full width. Box heights for long answers scale with the question's
# max_length so longer answers get more vertical room.
#
# Renders 2 pages per application:
#   1. Sections 1-5 + applicant signature block
#   2. Notary certification (designation, attestation, sigs)
#
# For blank-batch printing, pass `application: nil, count: N` to render
# N applications back-to-back in one document.

The Applicant shall maintain decorum throughout proceedings, defined for purposes of this ordinance as: not laughing audibly during the stamping, not narrating the Notary's signature in real time, and not attempting to high-five the Attaché unless reciprocity is clearly indicated.",
