# Ruby Embassy — Application Question Seed Data
#
# Source of truth for the initial Question Bank and Notary Pool. Loaded
# via `EmbassyQuestionsSeed.import!` from `db/seeds.rb`.
#
# The constants below are private to the importer. After the first seed,
# admins manage Questions and NotaryProfiles through `/admin/embassy_questions`
# — this file is only re-read when wiping/reseeding development data.
#
# `external_id` (e.g. "1a", "3a01", "N02") is the natural key used for
# upsert. Existing records are updated in place; new ones are created.
# Application data (answers, applications themselves) is never touched.
